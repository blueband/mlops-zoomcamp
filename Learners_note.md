Lesson 1.1
* Introduction to MLOPs
  - Art of putting ML model into production
  - sets of best practice for automating all ML processes required to put ML model into production
  - Basic ML process involved the following, 
    - Design  - deliberate on wether ML is suitable for the challenge under investigation
    - Train - experiment with different model/Algorithm
    - Operate (Deployment) - build API for end-user to interact Prediction interface

- MLOPs Help with
  - experimenting 
  - ability to reproduce result 
  - ability to retrain the Model easily
  - Ability to easily deploy the model
  - and monotoring the model performance
